# Here are few quick infos about me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Logic-Riddle
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of things like tailwind and react and I'm looking forward to even learn more libraries or frameworks like Laravel.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new ideas how I can make my own code better to improve my own knowledge.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects. If you have any questions about why I wrote something specific in my code, feel free to contact me.

- âš¡ Fun fact: In JS null == 0 and null > 0 is false but null >= 0 is true. That is because == compares the types and >= is a numeric operator and converts null to 0.
